 Here is the SQL query to get the statistics on which candidate has the most skills and show the skills:

```sql
WITH skills_count AS (
  SELECT 
    "candidate.contact.name",
    cardinality("candidate.skills.technical") + cardinality("candidate.skills.non-technical") AS total_skills
  FROM "customer_resume"."candidates"
)
SELECT 
  "candidate.contact.name", 
  "candidate.skills.technical",
  "candidate.skills.non-technical"
FROM "customer_resume"."candidates" 
INNER JOIN skills_count
ON "customer_resume"."candidates"."candidate.contact.name" = skills_count."candidate.contact.name"
ORDER BY skills_count.total_skills DESC
LIMIT 1
```

This uses a common table expression (CTE) to calculate the total number of skills for each candidate by getting the cardinality (number of elements) in the technical and non-technical skill arrays. It joins this back to the main table to select the actual skill arrays for the candidate with the most skills.

The ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses are used to sort by the skills count and select only the top candidate.

 Here is an updated SQL query that resolves the syntax error by qualifying the ambiguous column name:

```sql
WITH skills_count AS (
  SELECT 
    "candidates"."candidate.contact.name",
    cardinality("candidates"."candidate.skills.technical") + cardinality("candidates"."candidate.skills.non-technical") AS total_skills
  FROM "customer_resume"."candidates"
)
SELECT
  "candidates"."candidate.contact.name",
  "candidates"."candidate.skills.technical",
  "candidates"."candidate.skills.non-technical" 
FROM "customer_resume"."candidates"
INNER JOIN skills_count 
ON "candidates"."candidate.contact.name" = skills_count."candidate.contact.name"
ORDER BY skills_count.total_skills DESC 
LIMIT 1
```

The key changes:

- Qualified the ambiguous "candidate.contact.name" column with the table alias "candidates"
- Qualified the other column references with the "candidates" table alias

This resolves the syntax error and ensures the column references are unambiguous. The query otherwise aligns with the original requirements to show the candidate with the most skills and list out their skills.
